title: Hosting own Have I Been Pwned API
---

Ory Kratos uses the Have I Been Pwned (HiBP) API, with the k-anonymity flag,
to check if the password the user registers with has been a part of one 
of the previous leaks.

If your Kratos operates in an environment where the egress to the HiBP public
API hosted at haveibeenpwned.com is restricted via network policies, for
example as a result of CISO policies, you can host the HiBP API in-house
and configure Kratos to use your own instance of the API. To do so, configure
Kratos to use your API:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
selfservice:
  methods:
    password"
      config"
        haveibeenpwned_host: api.private.host
```

An example of a minimal self-hosted, k-anonymity enabled HiBP API [can be found
in this repository](https://github.com/radekg/hibp).

:::note

Ory Kratos `haveibeenpwned_host` setting does not allow configuring the
respective CA chain at the moment but it does require a TLS connection.
Therefore your private HiBP API must use one of the trusted CAs of the
underlying operating system.

A solution might be to host the HiBP API using a Let's Encrypt certificate
or install the private CA certificate in the trusted CA certificates
of the system on which Kratos is running.
